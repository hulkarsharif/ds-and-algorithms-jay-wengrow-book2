/*User
Imagine you have a chessboard and put a single grain of rice on one square. On the second square, you put 2 grains of rice, since that is double the amount of rice on the previous square. On the third square, you put 4 grains.

On the fourth square, you put 8 grains, and on the fifth square, you put 16 grains, and so on. The following function calculates which square youâ€™ll need to place a certain number of rice grains. For example, for 16 grains, the function will return 5.*/

const spacesNeeded = chessboardSpace(numberOfGrains);
